# staying_safe

This was my dissertation project completed during my final year at university.
It was an application created using Flutter and Dart. It was a safety application 
for students primarily females. The inital commit included all the code completed by the end of university.

I will now try and continue this application to better my flutter skills.

Features:
- Taxi hotline: users will be able to see a result of all local cab companies with a button to call them directly from the application
- Friend system to allow users to share their locations with a "friend" which can be set by the user
- SOS page allowing user to either call local emergency services or notify a "friend" that they are in danger/feel unsafe.
- Update TOMTOM maps to allow user to search for a destination along with destination finding from users current location.
